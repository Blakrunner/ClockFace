# ClockFace
Analog clock face using c++ and SFML


ClockFace is fully customizable, you can size, color, and set Digital clock inside ClockFace.

ClockFace can be used as a stop watch by using tick(), 
or show current time by using showTime(), then calling tick() every second.

ClockFace timing is controlled by you, there is no timing done, the 'tick' function only controls the movements no actual timing. You control the timing of calling the function 'tick'. I've created the main file shows possible settings.
